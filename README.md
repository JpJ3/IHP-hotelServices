# IHP-hotelServices
Location Based Services iOS App for hotels-prototype

Instructions iPhone:

This application is designed for iPhone 5 and above. The reason that happened is because I couldn’t test autolayout on an iPhone 4 because I didn’t have a device and the initial screen is a camera view and won’t work on the simulator.
To test the app I have attached some QR codes for scanning.

Use the following profile:
Username: kent 
Password: eda


This account works on both platforms (iPhone and WebPage).

if you want to test that the app communicates properly with the webpage you can use the webpage as well (refresh after a new request has been sent)

WebPage:

1.Download the zip file from dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/djmjr6myurwu17l/HotelManagement.zip?dl=0

2. unzip and follow the same process as above:

3.open the folder Hotel Management
4. open the dist folder
5. double-click index.html and run it locally
6. login with the same account
if there is any problem with the webpage please let me know.
